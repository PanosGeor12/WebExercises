00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.500
I told you they were gone.

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:02.500
Well, look who it is.

00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:05.500
Don't you have some poor, defenseless animal to disembowel?

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:06.500
Oh, they couldn't be far.

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:09.500
I mean, they went this way or this way or maybe...

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:12.000
You don't know much about tracking, do you?

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.500
Hey, I'm a sloth. I see a tree, eat a leaf.

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:15.500
That's my tracking.

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:17.500
You didn't miss them by much.

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:19.500
It's still green.

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.500
They headed north two hours ago.

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:24.000
Hey, it's still green. They headed north two hours ago.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.500
Hey.

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.500
You don't need this aggravation.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.500
Give me the baby.

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:36.000
I can track humans down a lot faster than you can.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.500
And you're just a good citizen helping out, right?

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:40.500
I just know where the humans are going.

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.500
Glacier Pass.

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:45.500
Everybody knows they have a settlement on the other side.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Well, unless you know how to track,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
you're never gonna reach them before the pass closes up with snow.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.500
Which should be like tomorrow.

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:59.000
So you can give that baby to me or go get lost in a blizzard.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
It's your choice.

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.500
There's your little bundle of joy.

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:11.500
We're returning it to the humans.

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:16.000
Oh, the big, bad Tigey Wigey gets left behind.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.500
Poor Tigey Wigey.

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:21.000
Sid, Tigey Wigey's gonna lead the way.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.500
Uh, uh, Manny, can I talk to you for a second?

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:28.500
No. The sooner we find the humans,

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.500
the sooner I get rid of Mr. Stinky Drool Face.

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.500
And the baby, too.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.500
You won't always have Jumbo around to protect you.

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.500
And when that day comes, I suggest you watch your back.

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:43.500
Because I'll be chewing on it.

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.000
Hey, Uber Tracker!

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.500
Up front where I can see you.

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:49.500
Help me.
